# Multimodal Interaction Project

This repository hosts a collection of machine learning models trained using Teachable Machine to recognize various modalities including American Sign Language (ASL), sounds of African musical instruments, and body poses. These models were developed as part of a course assignment to explore the capabilities of machine learning in recognizing diverse forms of human interaction.

## Overview

The project is divided into three main components:

1. **ASL Alphabet Recognition**: A model trained to recognize the letters of the American Sign Language alphabet.
2. **African Musical Instruments Sound Recognition**: This model can identify sounds from three traditional African musical instruments.
3. **Body Pose Recognition**: Trained to recognize specific body poses indicative of actions such as throwing, jumping, kicking, ducking, powering up, punching, and standing.

## Models

### 1. ASL Alphabet Recognition
- **Model URL**: [ASL Model](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/models/Brw7mJxkw/)
- **Description**: This model is capable of recognizing the handshapes corresponding to the 26 letters of the ASL alphabet.

### 2. African Musical Instruments Sound Recognition
- **Model URL**: [African Instruments Model](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/models/R4ybKNMn3/)
- **Instruments Recognized**:
  - Orutu: A single-stringed fiddle.
  - Nyatiti: A lyre-like stringed instrument.
  - Ohangla: Traditional drums.
- **Description**: This sound recognition model identifies distinct sounds produced by the Orutu, Nyatiti, and Ohangla, showcasing the rich musical heritage of Africa.

### 3. Body Pose Recognition
- **Model URL**: [Body Pose Model](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/models/FWcZxPsc0/)
- **Poses Recognized**: Throw, Jump, Kick, Duck, Power, Punch, Stand.
- **Description**: The model is trained to recognize seven different body poses, each representing a unique action, enhancing the interaction between humans and machines through physical movements.
