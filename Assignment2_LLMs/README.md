# Advanced LLM Demonstrations

This repository contains a comprehensive demonstration of advanced techniques using Large Language Models (LLMs), including tokenization, interactions with OpenAI's GPT models, a custom code interpreter, retrieval augmented generation, and fine-tuning LLMs for specific tasks.

## Overview

The project showcases the versatility and power of modern LLMs in processing and understanding human language. Through a series of structured demonstrations, we explore how these models can be leveraged to perform a wide range of NLP tasks, from understanding context in conversational AI to generating context-aware responses and tailoring models to specific applications.

## Features

- **Tokenization with Transformers**: Demonstrates the foundational step of preparing text data for LLMs.
- **Interacting with OpenAI's GPT Models**: Engages with the latest GPT models to showcase conversational AI capabilities.
- **Custom Code Interpreter**: Introduces a practical application of LLMs in executing specific coding tasks.
- **Retrieval Augmented Generation**: Utilizes the Wikipedia API to enrich model responses with real-time information.
- **Fine-Tuning LLMs**: Details the process of tailoring pre-trained models to specific needs, enhancing their performance on targeted datasets.
