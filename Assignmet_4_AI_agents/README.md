# Intelligent Agents with Python

Welcome to the GitHub repository where we explore the fascinating world of intelligent agents using Python. This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks: one detailing the process of building an intelligent agent from scratch, and another showcasing various agent types and their applications.

## Overview

In this project, we dive into creating and integrating intelligent agents capable of performing a wide range of tasks, from making personalized activity suggestions based on the user's mood and local weather conditions to translating phrases into multiple languages. Our agents leverage the latest advancements in AI and machine learning to provide intuitive and interactive digital experiences.

### Notebooks

1. **Agent from Scratch**: A detailed guide on building an intelligent agent that suggests activities based on mood and weather.
2. **Various Agent Types**: Demonstrates the capabilities of different agent types, including Zero-shot ReAct for language translation, Conversational ReAct for real-time weather updates, ReAct Docstore for navigating vast amounts of information, and a Self-Ask agent with web search capabilities.
