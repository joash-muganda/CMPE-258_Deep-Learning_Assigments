## Overview

This project delves into the advanced strategic reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), highlighting their potential impacts across various sectors such as economics, geopolitics, and artificial intelligence. The focus is on how these models not only process and generate language but also perform complex decision-making tasks that involve strategic reasoning.

## Medium Article

The Medium article provides a comprehensive review of recent advancements in the field of LLMs, focusing on their ability to engage in strategic thinking. It combines insights from a survey paper written in the second half of 2023 or 2024, exploring various non-standard modalities like tabular, graph, and time-series foundation models.
