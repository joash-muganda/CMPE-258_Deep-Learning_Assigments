# Deep Learning with Low-Code Libraries

## Overview

This repository showcases deep learning applications across a variety of domains using low-code libraries. It demonstrates the power and flexibility of FastAI, Hugging Face's Transformers, Keras-NLP, and Keras-CV for tasks in vision, natural language processing (NLP), and more. Through detailed Jupyter Notebooks, we explore the training and inference processes, emphasizing the practical application of these tools to achieve state-of-the-art results with minimal coding.
