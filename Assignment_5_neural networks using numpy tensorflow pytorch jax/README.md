# Exploring Basic Neural Networks with NumPy, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and JAX

This project delves into the basics of neural network architectures, showcasing their implementation and functionality across various popular libraries: NumPy, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and JAX. Each library offers unique approaches and utilities for neural network development, from low-level operations to high-level APIs. The project is organized into 13 notebooks, each tailored to demonstrate specific aspects and capabilities of these libraries in the context of simple neural network models.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to compare and contrast how basic neural networks can be implemented and managed across different programming environments. It serves as an educational toolkit for understanding the syntactical and conceptual differences among the libraries.
