# Computer vision assignments

This repository contains multiple parts showcasing different machine learning techniques.

## Part 1 - Supervised Contrastive Learning

We demonstrate supervised contrastive learning as a new loss function for classification tasks. The project includes a comparison between supervised contrastive learning and traditional softmax-based classification, providing clear visualizations to highlight the benefits and challenges.

## Part 2 - Transfer Learning on Various Modalities

Explore the concept of transfer learning across different data modalities: images, videos, and audio. Each notebook showcases two primary use cases:
1. **Feature Extraction** - Using pre-trained models as feature extractors.
2. **Fine-Tuning** - Adjusting pre-trained models to perform specific tasks.

### Key Modalities

1. **Image**: Learn how transfer learning can be applied to image classification.
2. **Video**: Utilize pre-trained models to recognize actions in videos.
3. **Audio**: Perform audio classification tasks using transfer learning.
4. **NLP**: Apply transfer learning for text classification tasks.

## Part 3 - Zero-Shot Transfer Learning

Implement zero-shot transfer learning techniques using advanced models. Zero-shot learning allows models to classify data without direct supervision, making it a powerful technique for dealing with unfamiliar datasets.
